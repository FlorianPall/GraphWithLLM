# GraphWithLLM
## Structure
The project is divided into these main parts:
1. The `src` folder contains the external files of the project.
2. The code files on root level are the main files of the project.
3. The `DB` folder contains the files for the database.

## Src Folder
The `src` folder needs the following files:
- For structure check:
  1. `LLM_Angaben.yml` - Contains the graph structure.
  2. `LLM_Graph.txt` - Contains the graph data (Cipher for Neo4j).
- For the ESCO Skills:
  1. Folder `ESCO` - Contains the ESCO Skills in different csv Files
  2. Folder `Output` - Contains the output files.
- For the Modules:
  1. Folder `Modules` - Contains the Modules in pdf format.
- For the AI:
  1. Folder `Prompts` - Contains the Prompts for the AI.
- For the config:
    1. `general.yml` - Contains the configuration for the program. You can add your own configuration in this folder.
- In order to use the project parts individually and for better traceability:
    1. Folder `Cache` - Contains the results of the individual steps.

##### Config Structure
- Modulestructure: Contains the structure of the Modules in the pdf files. You can add headings in the desired language.
- LLM_Structure: Contains the structure of the graph. You can add nodes and edges with their properties.
- Ignored_Properties_Merging: Contains the properties that should be ignored when merging the graphs.
- Ignored_Nodes_Merging: Contains the nodes that should be ignored when merging the graphs.
- Caching: Contains the files that will be cached, you can change the names of the files to your liking.

### What can the program do?
- Structure
  1. Check the Graph structure of the txt file based on the yml structure. For the Moment only Edges can be checked.
  2. If edges have been deleted, the program will show the edges, delete them and checks the syntax of the cipher.
  3. The Result will be saved in a new file named `LLM_Graph_Output.txt`. This file will be written in the same directory as the input file. This will also be written if the input file is correct.
- ESCO DB
  1. The Program will setup da Database in the docker container with the Structure of 'DB/init.sql'. 
  2. Then it will automatically insert all the ESCO Skills in the DB. It will use all csv files in the ESCO folder no matter what names the files have.
  3. Extract preferred labels and descriptions from the DB and save them in a new csv file.
- Modules
  1. Extract the Modules from the pdf files and build a json structure in a useful way.
- Merging Graphs
  1. Merge the graphs into one graph. The graphs are in the `Cache` folder in a json format. The system will detect duplicates, merge them and save the result in the `Cache` folder.

### How to use the program?
#### Setup
1. Install the required packages
2. Create the folder Structure as described in the following section.
3. Use the `general.yml` file to configure the program or create your own config file.
4. Get a module and store it in the `Modules` folder.
5. Check the prompts in the `Prompts` folder.
6. Get the ESCO Skills and store them in the `ESCO` folder.

#### Run
You have to run the `main.py` file. You can use the following flags:
- `--escodb` to setup the ESCO DB and insert the data.
- `--extractpdf` to extract the Modules from the pdf files. Value is the filename.
- `--structure` to check the graph structure of the txt file.
- `--escolabel` read ESCO-DB and extract preferred label and description.
- `--all` to run all the functions at once.
- `--config` to use a different config file. Value is the filename. Default is `general.yml`. Your own config needs the same structure as the `general.yml`.
- `--merge` to merge graphs into one.
- `--folderstructure` to create the folder structure for the project.

#### Results
The different results of each step will be saved in the `Cache` folder. The final result will be saved in the `Output` folder.
